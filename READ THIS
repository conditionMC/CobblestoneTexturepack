This texturepack is fan-made and specificly for Cobblestone
Do not steal any model or texture from this pack
The pack does require OPTIFINE and if you're using fabric then get OPTIFINE and OPTIFABRIC
This was made for 1.19.4 and have not tested on anything else but it should work in more versions
There might not be too many features but its growing trust me

To get the texture pack follow these steps,
1. Left click on "Cobblestone.zip"
2. Left click on where it says "View Raw" and it should begin the download (if it doesnt then click on the right on the download button)
3. Go into minecraft and click "esc" then "options" then "Resource Packs" and click open pack folder
4. Drag the .zip file into the folder and unzip it, delete the .zip after it is finished
5. Click on "Cobblestone" so it goes into the right hand side
6. Click done and enjoy

If ur having trouble, dm me on disc pro_jirko or send me a msg in minecraft
More features are being added every day
